## Stochastic model simulation code

License: MIT License

### System requirements

The stochastic model simulation code is provided as Jupyter notebooks running Python 3.

The following versions of the dependencies were used:

* jupyter notebook 6.0.1
* matplotlib 3.1.1
* numpy 1.17.2
* pandas 0.25.1
* seaborn 0.9.0
* scipy 1.3.1

This code was tested on MacOS Mojave and Catalina, but should readily work on other operating systems that support Jupyter notebooks.

### Installation guide

We recommend using Anaconda to install all the required dependencies: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/

Alternatively all the packages above are pip-installable `pip install matplotlib numpy pandas seaborn scipy`

### Demo and instructions for use

The stochastic model Jupyter notebooks are provided as stand-alone scripts and can be simply re-run to reproduce the simulation results.
